Check out what JH suggests in lesson 0 of v5 of the course.\nI started my fast.ai journey with v3 of the course and contributed in the analytics of the people who haven’t finished it as Jeremy mentions in that video. So, “Finish the damn course”, is that sentence which I’d like to keep me haunting, motivating and persevering and so is the name of my blog."
