The "FTDC" blog or **F**inish **T**he **D**amn **C**ourse blog, is place where I journal my progress, document the project I create and share my learnings while doing [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/).

FYI: If you wonder, why this name? Check out what JH suggests in [lesson 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=175s) of v5 of the course. 

I started my fast.ai journey with v3 of the course and contributed in the analytics of the people who haven't finished it as Jeremy mentions in that video. So, "Finish the damn course", is that sentence which I'd like to keep me haunting, motivating and persevering and so is the name of my blog.
